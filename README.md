**Houses**<br>
The roofs over our heads and a place to call our home for our family and friends.<br>
Everything comes at a price unfortunately and so the architecture of these houses<br><br>
In the second beginner's problem from Kaggle, A house price dataset is given to us and we need to use Regression methods to predict the house prices based on what we find from the training set<br>
**What I did**<br>
I took some help in learning which regression model to use since my usual methods were terrible when looking at the parameter that this challenge is measured by a parameter called Root Mean Square Error(RMSE)<br>
Learned about using Lasso Regression which helps to reduce overfitting thereby reducing the RMSE value greatly
RMSE:0.11922(Took some help in learning what regression model to use)<br>
